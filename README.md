SMS Spam Detection Using NLP
SMS spam detection is the most widely used application in Natural Language Processing. It is a text classification model, in which the goal is to classify text messages as a "Spam" (unwanted, promotional, or phishing) message or a "Ham" (legitimate message), thus filtering out unwanted or malicious messages.

The process begins with gathering a dataset of SMS messages labeled as "Spam" or "Ham." Each message is then preprocessed to clean and normalize the text. Preprocessing includes removing non-alphanumeric characters, converting text to lowercase, removing stopwords (like "and," "the," "is"), and lemmatizing words to their base forms (e.g., "running" â†’ "run").

Once the text is cleaned, it uses feature extraction methods like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for converting the text into numerical representations. These numerical features are further used to train machine learning models. A good choice for this task is the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm, which has been known to work well in text classification problems.

The effectiveness of the trained model can be validated with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, which guarantee it will not spam the correct identification of messages. When validated, it can predict if a new incoming message is spam or not.

SMS spam detection is very relevant in email filtering, SMS-based marketing, and fraud prevention. Users will receive only relevant and secure communications; hence, this is an important
